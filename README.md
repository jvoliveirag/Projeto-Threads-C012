This repository contains the project of the "Operating Systems" subject of the National Institute of Telecommunications - INATEL, which aims to apply and practice the concepts of threads.

# The ideia üí°	

The ideia is basicaly create a simmulation of a bunch of sensors that need to be read simultaneously.

# Using Threads üßµ	

To do so, I applyed the concepts of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html">Threads</a>, with python in order to create a program able to monitor the value - and the state (if it's alarmed or not) - of the sensors at the "same time".

# Mongo üçÉ	

To store the (fake) sensor data I used the MongoDB Compass and connected it localy with the application, so the sensors could be updated and their values checked all the time.

# Conclusion ‚öñÔ∏è

After the tests and seeing the results we can conclude that using Threads is a powerful way to improve our applications in terms of time and execution, since we need to do things "simultaneously".
